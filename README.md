# The Location-based WiFi Services system: A Complete Open Source Solution for Wi-Fi Beacon Stuffing Based Location-based Services

## 0. What is LoWS?
Omnipresent Wi-Fi access points (APs) periodically
broadcast beacon frames to inform potential stations (STAs)
about their existence. Beacon frames can be extended by adding
additional information (so-called beacon stuffing) making it pos-
sible to deliver this information to mobile devices (smart-phones,
tablets, etc. equipped with 802.11 interfaces) without the need for
their association with the local infrastructure. This feature can be
used to support location-based information services (LBS) related
for e.g. to advertising local opportunities, temporary obstacles
and traffic disturbances or emergency notifications.
The Location-based WiFi Services system is the technical solutions for LBS
support of using 802.11 beacon stuffing. 
LoWS supports an original, highly efficient way to encode the delivered
information. The LoWS system can be integrated in an existent
802.11 infrastructure while the receiver application can be
installed on commercial off-the-shelf Android devices. The LoWS
system is modular with well-defined interfaces making it to an
attractive tool for modifications, changes and improvements.
